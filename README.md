# Churn_prediction
#Dataset:
The dataset churn_prediction_simple.csv contains features related to customers and the target variable indicating churn.

#Modeling:
A Decision Tree classifier is used to predict customer churn. The data is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and scaled before training the model.

#Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

#Hyperparameter Tuning:
Hyperparameters like max_depth, min_samples_split, max_leaf_nodes, and min_samples_leaf are tuned to improve the model's performance.

#Feature Importance:
Feature importance is visualized to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction.

#Results:
The final model's performance is presented, highlighting key metrics and visualizations.
